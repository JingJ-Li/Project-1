title: API access function
---

What is introduced here is a Function  Vignettes about a set of functions which can get access of some endpoints of two APIs ([NHL records API](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/records-api.md) and [NHL stats API](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/stats-api.md)). The same idea can be applied to construction of new functions to extend API endpoints. Basically modifiers are attached to basic urls through inputting specified ID or variable name by the users. Logic statements are created to direct functions to indivifual records corresponding to input id or whole records of datasets. Then a wrapper function is designed to assign the flexibility to the users to choose different functions, datasets and recording by input specified name, id and other key words. The utilization of the functions is examplified by various tables and graphs based on the data returned by  those functions. Hopefully you enjoy these functions!
